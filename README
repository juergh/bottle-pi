Bottle-pi is a simple REST API server that manages a bunch of Raspberry Pis.

It's somewhat compliant to the Redfish API and is intended to run on a
master Pi, that acts as a controller of 'the bunch of Raspberry Pis'.

The RUN pin and GPIO4 of each Pi are connected to GPIOs of the controller Pi.
The serial port of each Pi is also connected to the controller Pi via a
serial-USB adapter and USB Hub.

The details of how things are cabled up is specifed in bottle-pi.config
